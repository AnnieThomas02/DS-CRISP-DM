Udacity Data Science Nanodegree Project 1 follows CRISP-DM
# Analysing pricing of Airbnb Seattle
## Project overview:-
The purpose of this project is to identify the aspects of Airbnb host listings that have a correlation to the price . This information will allow Airbnb hosts to find and improve certain variables of their listing that are the highest indicators when it comes to setting price. Our predictive model can provide rough estimates as to how much your Airbnb in Seattle should be listed at based on your listing criteria. 

As an additional insight, we also included exploratory analysis through a predictive model on the ratings of listings at the bottom of the notebook.
Project Structure
This project follows CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology. Steps followed in this project:
*	Business objective: Analyze the price, how can you predict , discuss how price can contribute to neighborhood , factors that influence prices(does the number of bedrooms and guest included contribute to price), how price vary for property type and what guests say about their experience with Airbnb.
*	Data Processing: Applied certain data cleaning and wrangling techniques, handled missing data, impute where necessary, removed the outliers, and perform some text preprocessing.
*	Modeling: Answer questions by using appropriate aggregate method following statistical standards.
*	Evaluation: Present the result of the analysis in form of tables and graphs.


For this project data used [Seattle Airbnb data](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data). The code is all contained in the Jupyter notebook incuded in the project. The data cleaning and preparation is performed primarily in the Data-Cleaning.ipynb notebook link . All of the data exploration, model training, parameter selection, and analysis is performed in the main price-analysis.ipynb notebook link.Simply clone this project into a directory and then download the Airbnb Seattle data and add the three csv files to a sub-directory named "seattle". I also wrote a Medium post about this project which can be found here.
